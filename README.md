Count Proximo Wordpress Theme
===

This theme is a showcase of skills ranging from Photoshop web design to Wordpress. I designed the mockup in photoshop with a vision in mind, converted the design to static HTML, and converted said HTML into a live Wordpress website. The website itself includes several critical plugins like ACF and CPT UI, which allow the user to alter most elements on the site easily.
